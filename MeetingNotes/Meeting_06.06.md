# Meeting Notes

## Last weeks progress
1. Loading the dataset using skimage and calculating the mean of the faces
2. Defining functions for loading the dataset and visualizing the result


## Questions
- How can we use a variable from a function that we have created, how to define a function which uses functions we have already defined?
## Plans for next week
 Defining a function for PCA
 Using indexes (numbers corresponding to filenames) to separate the dataset into folders and define the process as a function
 
## Problems 
 Georgi has sent his laptop to be repaired (cannot attend tutorium)
 Maria has an exam during the tutorium
