# Meeting Notes
**06.07.2021**

## Last weeks progress
1. Improving the code for pca and knn 


## Questions
- Using the KNN class, we can only see the number of pictures, like the new_image from the testing set is near image 33 for example, but how can we see the name of this picture, like to which person does it belong? 

## Plans for next week
- Starting the report 
- Write further applications
