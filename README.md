## Abstract

K-Nearest Neighbors or shortly KNN is one of the least complex and widely used classification methods in Data Analysis. In this project, KNN is used to classify images by the presence of certain people in them. The classification takes into consideration the facial features of the person present in each image, which is obtained by performing dimensional reduction with an algorithm called Principal Component Analysis or shortly PCA. The program receives a large folder of pictures divided into sub-folders, each subfolder containing a collection of pictures of a certain person. This data set is then divided into two parts, the testing set and the training set, and the purpose of the program is to determine in which sub-folder of the training set the images from the testing set belong. In the end, the accuracy of the program is calculated based on the number of correctly assigned pictures.
